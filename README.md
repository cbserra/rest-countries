## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field:
  - **CBS Addition**: Clicking on the 'Search for a country' `input` field will display a menu,
    listing all available countries. Upon selecting a country, the user will be
    presented with the Country's detail page.
- Filter countries by region:
  - **CBS Addition**: Choosing a region will filter the Country's listed by that selected region.
    Clearing the value will reset the view back to the original listing of all countries.
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode:
  - **CBS Addition**: The application will check LocalStorage to see if a `mode` has been saved for the application already.
  If not, it will check the `system`'s mode to determine if a theme has been set. A system theme will render
  the application with that theme. If not, it will default to `light` theme.

### What I learned

I followed a few blog posts, discussing `useContext` hook and `createContext`. Implemented following these posts/sandboxes:

- [Building Dark Mode in React: The Fun Way | JavaScript Works](https://javascript.works-hub.com/learn/building-dark-mode-in-react-the-fun-way-424f6)
- [Light/dark mode: React Implementation](https://dev.to/ayc0/light-dark-mode-react-implementation-3aoa#defining-the-context)
  - [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/themes-tbclf?file=/src/theme.tsx)

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
